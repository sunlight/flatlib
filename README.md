# riftlib

Riftlib is a fork of [Flatangle's Flatlib](https://github.com/flatangle/flatlib) python library for Traditional Astrology. Much gratitude goes to JoÃ£o Ventura for laying the difficult groundwork from which I've built.

```python
>>> date = Datetime('2015/03/13', '17:00', '+00:00')
>>> pos = GeoPos('38n32', '8w54')
>>> chart = Chart(date, pos)

>>> sun = chart.get(const.SUN)
>>> print(sun)
<Sun Pisces +22:47:25 +00:59:51>
```
